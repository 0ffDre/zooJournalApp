cst-391 Milestone 3
# This CRUD Application is in the theme zoo animals, where visitors of the zoo are able to document, create, remove, update, and delete entries in their journal. 
This is in the perspective that visitors will be able to “go to” the zoo's website and as they walk around the zoo, they document different animals they see with pre-determined options/descriptions they can add.
